Hard link: point to the the hard drive
- if 2  hard link point to the same spot in the hard drive
 -> modifing 1 file will modify both file (like pointer)

- symbolic file:
 + File_1: hard link: point to a spot on hard drive
 + File_2: soft link: point to file 1 (small, like pointer)
 If file_1 is delete -> file 2 is also gone
