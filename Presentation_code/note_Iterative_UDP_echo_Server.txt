## UDP Echo Server

1. The server creates a UDP socket using the `socket()` system call. The `socket()` function takes three arguments: the address family (in this case, `AF_INET` for IPv4), the socket type (in this case, `SOCK_DGRAM` for UDP), and the protocol (in this case, `IPPROTO_UDP` for UDP).

2. The server binds the socket to a specific IP address and port using the `bind()` system call. In this example, the server binds to all available network interfaces using the `INADDR_ANY` constant and port 5000.

3. The server enters an infinite loop to receive and process incoming messages from clients. In each iteration of the loop, the server waits for a message to arrive using the `recvfrom()` system call. The `recvfrom()` function takes five arguments: the socket file descriptor, a buffer to store the incoming message, the maximum size of the buffer, flags (in this case, 0), and a pointer to a `sockaddr` structure that will be filled in with the address of the client that sent the message.

4. Once the server receives a message, it sends the same message back to the client using the `sendto()` system call. The `sendto()` function takes six arguments: the socket file descriptor, the message to send, the length of the message, flags (in this case, 0), a pointer to a `sockaddr` structure that contains the address of the client to send the message to, and the size of the `sockaddr` structure.

5. The server then goes back to waiting for the next message to arrive.

## UDP Echo Client

1. The client creates a UDP socket using the `socket()` system call, just like the server.

2. The client sets the address and port of the server it wants to communicate with using a `sockaddr_in` structure. In this example, the server IP address is set to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) and the port is set to 5000.

3. The client enters an infinite loop to send messages to the server and receive responses. In each iteration of the loop, the client prompts the user to enter a message using `fgets()`, sends the message to the server using the `sendto()` system call, and waits for a response using the `recvfrom()` system call.

4. Once the client receives a response from the server, it prints the response to the console.

5. The client then goes back to prompting the user for the next message to send.
